## 🏃‍♂️ Overview

**Private Sports Analyzer** is a revolutionary decentralized application that enables athletes to track, analyze, and share their performance data while maintaining complete privacy. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, it allows computations on encrypted data without ever revealing sensitive personal metrics.

## 🎯 Core Concept

### FHE-Powered Confidential Sports Performance Analysis

Traditional fitness tracking applications expose your personal health data to centralized servers, creating privacy risks and potential data breaches. **Private Sports Analyzer** solves this problem using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** - a groundbreaking cryptographic technique that enables:

- **Encrypted Data Processing**: All performance metrics (heart rate, calories, duration, distance, intensity, recovery time) are encrypted on-chain
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Statistical analysis and performance evaluations are computed directly on encrypted data
- **Confidential Comparisons**: Athletes can participate in leaderboards and goal tracking without revealing actual performance numbers
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove achievements and milestones without disclosing sensitive health metrics

### How It Works

1. **Athlete Registration**: Users register with their preferred sport category
2. **Encrypted Performance Recording**: All workout sessions are encrypted using FHE before being stored on-chain
3. **Confidential Analysis**: Smart contracts perform statistical computations on encrypted data
4. **Private Leaderboards**: Rankings are generated without exposing individual metrics
5. **Goal Achievement Verification**: Prove you met fitness goals without revealing exact performance data

## 🔐 Smart Contract

**Deployed on Sepolia Testnet**

```
Contract Address: 0x430f85Cc4Ea7bddA82fd6Dd156A06747EdeC0313
