# Demo Video Guide (demo.mp4)

This guide provides a detailed script and outline for creating the demo.mp4 video that demonstrates the FHEVM Universal SDK.

## Video Requirements

- **Duration**: 8-12 minutes
- **Format**: MP4 (1080p recommended)
- **Audio**: Clear narration explaining each step
- **Screen Recording**: Show actual application usage

## Video Structure

### 1. Introduction (1 minute)

**Visual**: Title slide with project name

**Script**:
```
"Welcome to the FHEVM Universal SDK demonstration.

This project provides a framework-agnostic SDK for building confidential
decentralized applications using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on Ethereum.

The SDK works with React, Next.js, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript, making it
easy for any web developer to build privacy-preserving dApps.

Let me show you how it works."
```

**Show**:
- Repository README
- Project structure overview
- Key features list

---

### 2. Installation & Setup (2 minutes)

**Visual**: Terminal and code editor

**Script**:
```
"Getting started is incredibly simple - less than 10 lines of code.

First, clone the repository and install dependencies using our monorepo
setup with npm workspaces."
```

**Show**:
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd fhevm-react-template

# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Build the SDK
npm run build:sdk
```

**Script continues**:
```
"The SDK is now built and ready to use in any of our example applications.
Let's start with the Next.js example."
```

**Show**:
- File structure in VS Code
- Built SDK files in packages/fhevm-sdk/dist

---

### 3. Next.js Example (3 minutes)

**Visual**: Browser showing Next.js application

**Script**:
```
"Our first example is a Next.js 14 application with full SDK integration.

Starting the development server is just one command."
```

**Show**:
```bash
npm run dev:nextjs
```

**Visual**: Application loading in browser

**Script continues**:
```
"The SDK initializes automatically through the FhevmProvider component.

Let's connect a wallet and demonstrate encryption."
```

**Demonstrate**:
1. Click "Connect MetaMask"
2. Approve connection
3. Show connected wallet address
4. Enter contract address
5. Select encryption type (uint32)
6. Enter value to encrypt (e.g., 42)
7. Click "Encrypt Value"
8. Show encrypted output (JSON with handles and proof)

**Script**:
```
"As you can see, the SDK encrypted our value of 42 into a format that
can be sent to our FHEVM smart contract.

The encrypted data includes handles and input proofs that the contract
can process without ever seeing the original value."
```

**Demonstrate Decryption**:
1. Switch to Decryption tab
2. Paste encrypted value
3. Click "Decrypt Value"
4. Approve EIP-712 signature in MetaMask
5. Show decrypted result: 42

**Script**:
```
"Decryption requires an EIP-712 signature to prove you're authorized.
Only the wallet that encrypted the data (or has permission) can decrypt it."
```

---

### 4. Sports Analyzer Example (3 minutes)

**Visual**: Sports Analyzer application

**Script**:
```
"Now let's see a real-world example: our Privacy-Preserving Sports Analyzer.

This application demonstrates how FHEVM can protect sensitive health and
performance data while still allowing athletes to track progress and compete."
```

**Show**:
```bash
npm run dev:sports
```

**Visual**: Sports Analyzer UI

**Demonstrate Registration**:
1. Connect wallet
2. Enter sport: "Running"
3. Click "Register Athlete"
4. Show transaction confirmation

**Script**:
```
"Athletes register with their sport, and all performance metrics are
encrypted on-chain."
```

**Demonstrate Recording Performance**:
1. Fill in performance form:
   - Heart Rate: 155
   - Calories: 450
   - Duration: 45 minutes
   - Distance: 5000 meters
   - Intensity: 8
   - Recovery Time: 60 minutes
2. Click "Record Performance"
3. Show transaction

**Script**:
```
"The contract encrypts these sensitive metrics using TFHE operations.
Nobody can see your exact performance data - not even the contract owner."
```

**Demonstrate Analysis**:
1. Click "Update Analysis"
2. Show transaction
3. Explain encrypted analytics

**Script**:
```
"The contract computes encrypted analytics like average heart rate and
improvement scores. These calculations happen on encrypted data without
ever decrypting it."
```

**Demonstrate Leaderboard**:
1. Enter category: "Endurance"
2. Click "Submit to Leaderboard"
3. Explain privacy benefits

**Script**:
```
"Athletes can compete on leaderboards with their encrypted improvement
scores. You can see who's on the leaderboard, but not their exact scores.
This provides competitive motivation while preserving privacy."
```

---

### 5. SDK Architecture (1 minute)

**Visual**: Architecture diagram from README

**Script**:
```
"The SDK uses a clean architecture with three layers:

At the core is framework-agnostic TypeScript code that handles all FHEVM
operations.

The adapter layer provides React hooks, Vue composables, and other
framework-specific integrations.

Applications simply import the adapter they need - React developers use
hooks, Vue developers use composables, and vanilla JavaScript developers
use the core SDK directly."
```

**Show**:
- Diagram from README
- Code snippets showing different integrations

---

### 6. Code Walkthrough (2 minutes)

**Visual**: VS Code with code examples

**Script**:
```
"Using the SDK is intuitive. Here's a complete example."
```

**Show in editor**:
```typescript
import { FhevmProvider, useFhevm, useEncrypt, useDecrypt } from '@fhevm/sdk/react';

// Wrap your app with the provider
<FhevmProvider network="sepolia" contractAddress="0x...">
  <App />
</FhevmProvider>

// Use hooks in your components
function MyComponent() {
  const { sdk, isReady } = useFhevm();
  const { encrypt } = useEncrypt();
  const { decrypt } = useDecrypt();

  // Encrypt a value
  const encrypted = await encrypt.uint32(100, contractAddr, userAddr);

  // Send to contract
  await contract.submitValue(encrypted.handles[0], encrypted.inputProof);

  // Decrypt a result
  const result = await decrypt.uint32(handle, userAddr, contractAddr);
}
```

**Script**:
```
"Just three hooks give you complete access to FHEVM encryption and
decryption with loading states, error handling, and TypeScript types."
```
